It is extremely doubtful that we-can remove them completely.

A marked paradigm shift has occurred from a system seeking to foster food security on the basis of the free exchange of knowledge, to a system seeking to achieve the same goal on the basis of the private appropriation of knowledge.  Monsanto has recently filed 475 lawsuits against farmers. One particular case has caught the headlines - Percy Schmeiser, a Saskatchewan, Canada, canola farmer ordered to pay US$ 400,000 to Monsanto in compensation for a canola crop which Schmeiser insists he did not plant, arguing that his crop was contaminated by Monsanto seed. The Special Rapporteur believes that whilst the patent rights of corporations must be protected, the rights of small farmers must also be protected.<div class="bigquo"><img src="/assets/rdquo.png"></div><p>&mdash; Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Jean Ziegler, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2003/25* </div>
