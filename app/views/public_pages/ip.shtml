				      <h2>New and improved plant varieties are one way of achieving better yields and adaptability to global change, both of which are important to food security.</h2>
				      <p>
Plant variety protection (PVP) is a type of intellectual property intended to provide an incentive to invest in research and development of new and improved plant varieties <span class="upov-provisions-intext"><a href="./upov.shtml?upovSection=provisions">(UPOV Provisions)</a></span>. But like all intellectual property, PVP protects only varieties that fit within certain strict criteria, usually that the variety be distinct, uniform and stable <span class="upov-provisions-intext"><a href="./upov.shtml?upovSection=provisions">(UPOV Provisions)</a></span>.</p><p> UPOV and UPOV-style systems are designed to protect new varieties developed by professional plant breeders from public and private institutions. Through its definition and processes, mainstream PVP has supported the development of plant varieties that are high yielding, genetically homogeneous and stable, and well adapted to large-scale industrialized agriculture. 
	<h3>Background</h3>
							<p><img src="images/ip-rice.png" alt="" style="float: right; 	margin: 0 30px 10px 0;	">
								People have been conserving and developing plant varieties since Neolethic times when humans began to slowly make a transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and in that process began to whittle down the number of species used for food. There was a reduction in the number of species used for food but an explosion in diversity from recombination of genes as plants were bred and crossed. It is only in the last several decades that intellectual property created the legal means to extract benefits from developing new plant varieties. These IP systems, including PVP systems, are constructed so that benefits accrue to professional plant breeders and scientists, with no similar benefit mechanisms for the conservation or innovative activities of farmers.
							</p><p>
								PVP is associated with creating incentives for private sector breeders and scientists to develop new, uniform and stable varieties. Prior to the widespread establishment of plant variety protection in industrialized countries, public and private philanthropy funded plant breeders who developed a new set of high yielding varieties that greatly increased agricultural production, particularly in rice and wheat. This effort, referred to as the Green Revolution, increased production and incomes where field conditions could be standardized by providing inputs such as water and fertilizer so that economies of scale could be achieved. It largely bypassed areas where input-intensive agriculture was not economically and/or environmentally feasible. 
<h3>PVP and Large-Scale Agriculture</h3>
							<p><img src="images/breeding.png" alt="" style="float: right; 	margin: 0 30px 10px 0;	">
								With intellectual property protection, including PVP, agricultural research in industrialized countries became an increasingly private sector endeavor with a concomitant expansion of large-scale commercial agriculture. The large scale agriculture begun under the Green Revolution and expanded through private sector involvement has increased productivity, but has also had a number of undesirable effects. <p>Large-scale agriculture is: <ul>
									<li>the main driver for the loss of agrobiodiversity<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
									<li>the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions</li><li>
								the largest consumer of freshwater resources, accounting for fully 70%</li><li>
								a major source of toxicity and water pollution from the use of pesticides and fertilizers.</li></ul>
								<p>
								This is not to say that large scale farming is inappropriate in all cases, or that professional plant breeders and scientists do not have an important role to play in the development of varieties and technologies to face the challenges of creating a more sustainable agriculture and food system. But it is important to note that although the world has made great leaps in production, the overall number of people affected by chronic hunger has hardly changed. Half the food produced today is produced by 1.5 billion farmers working on small plots of land for which monocultures would never be sustainable.	</p><p>

								We need to have a serious discourse about the food security and developmental implications for changes in the legal status of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture under current and proposed intellectual property rights regimes. And the dialogue needs to be inclusive, to include not just the private sector and political elite, but farmers and the associations that represent them.</p>
								<p>We cannot decouple discussions of intellectual property systems, including PVP, from the broader issues of food security. If intellectual property is to operate for the “benefit of society” we need to broaden the conversation and better understand the interconnections so the private sector can do what it does best, the public sector can be sufficiently strong and we can forge effective alliances among civil, public and the private sectors.</p>
